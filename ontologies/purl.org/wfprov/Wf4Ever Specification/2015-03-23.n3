The WorkflowRun is also a ProcessRun, and so the overall inputs and outputs of thw workflow execution can be described in the same manner.\n\nThese provenance details are linked to the corresponding wfdesc descriptions using wfdesc:describedbyProcess, wfdesc:describedByWorkflow and wfdesc:describedByParameter.\n\n\nThis ontology can be further linked to more specific provenance ontologies like OPM-V or W3C PROV-O, but this should be done separately."@en ;
