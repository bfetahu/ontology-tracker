        dc:description    "CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL to enable characterization of the nature or type of citations, both factually and rhetorically, and to permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.  \n\nThe citations characterized may be either direct and explicit (as in the reference list of a journal article), indirect (e.g. a citation to a more recent paper by the same research group on the same topic), or implicit (e.g. as in artistic quotations or parodies, or in cases of plagiarism).\n\nCiTO contains the object property cito:cites and its sub-properties, and its inverse property cito:isCitedBy, from the original Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6.  Upon the creation of version 2.0 of CiTO, a number of new sub-properties of cito:cites were added, and the inverse properties of all the sub-properties of cito:cites were created, all of which are sub-properties of cito:isCitedBy.  The ontology has also been integrated with the SWAN Discourse Relationships Ontology by making cito:cites a sub-property of http://purl.org/swan/2.0/discourse-relationships/refersTo.\n\nRestrictions of domain and range present in the previous version of CiTO were removed from the object properties when creating CiTO v 2.0, permitting its independent use in other contexts, in addition to conventional bibliographic citations.  \n\nSo that they can be used independently, other entities that were previously included in CiTO v1.6 have now been made components of other SPAR ontologies: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology; C4O, the Citation Counting and Context Characterization Ontology; and PSO, the Publication Status Ontology. \n\nThe addition of two new properties:cito:usesConclusionsFrom and its inverse cito:providesConclusionsFor on 09Dec2011 led to a version number increment from v2.0 to v2.1.\n\nThe addition of two additional properties, cito:compiles and cito:isCompiledBy, previously in the deprecated CiTO4Data ontology, on 03 July 2012 led to a version increment from v2.1 to v2.2.\n\nSubsequent expansions include:\n\nin versions 2.3 and 2.4 the addition of the object properties cito:citesAsPotentialSolution, cito:citesAsRecommended, cito:repliesTo, cito:retracts, cito:speculates on, and their inverse properties;\n\nin v2.5 the addition of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationEvent, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;\n\nin v 2.6: \nrenaming cito:hasCitationEvent to become cito:hasCitationCharacterization;\nimproving definitions of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;\nrevising the definition of cito:isCompiledBy to correct it and bring it into line with the DataCite Metadata Kernel v2.2 definition;\nchanging the definition of cito:sharesAuthorsWith from 'An object property indicating that the citing entity has at least one author in common with the cited entity.' to 'An object property between two entities indicating that they have at least one author in common.' so that it can be used when one entity does not actually cite the other;\nadding the object properties cito:hasRelatedEntity, cito:sharesFundingAgencyWith and cito:sharesAuthorInstitutionWith;\nand adding the text 'An object property indicating that . . .' at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property.\n\nin v 2.6.1:\nRemoved text 'An object property indicating that . . .' added in v 2.6 at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property, so that each definition is just a direct statement of the relationship.  \nRemoved the property cito:hasRelatedEntity (in favour of using dcterms:relation).\nRenamed cito:hasReply to become cito:hasReplyFrom.\nImproved the textual definitions of cito:derides and its inverse property.\n\nin v 2.6.2:\nImproved definitions of of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity.\n\nin v 2.6.3:\nAdded examples for each citation type (i.e., all the subproperties of cito:cites).\n\n"^^xsd:string ;

        rdfs:comment         "A citation act is a performative act of making a citation from a citing entity to a cited entity, typically instantiated by the inclusion of a bibliographic reference or a data reference in the reference list of the citing entity.\n\nThis CiTO class and its accompanying object properties cito:hasCitingEntity, cito:hasCitationCharacterization and cito:hasCitedEntity can be employed to reify direct citation act statements made using the CiTO citation object property cito:cites or one of its sub-properties. For example, the following RDF statement:\n\n     :paperA cito:extends :paperB .\n\ncan be alternatively described as follows:\n\n     :thisCitation a cito:CitationAct ; \n          cito:hasCitingEntity :paperA ;\n          cito:hasCitationCharacterization cito:extends ;\n          cito:hasCitedEntity :paperB .\n\nThis usage involved OWL2 punning, whenby a CiTO object property, such as the aforementioned cito:extends, is used as the object of the OWL assertion\n\n     :thisCitation cito:hasCitationCharacterization cito:extends .\n\nUsing such OWL2 punning (described at http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-owl2-new-features-20090611/#F12:_Punning), the CiTO object property is considered as a proper named individual of the class owl:Thing.\n\nSuch reification of citation acts can be very useful, since it permits one to combine these CiTO properties with other vocabularies, or to handle situations in which none of the citation characterizations available in CiTO are applicable.  Such situations can be resolved by the creation of a user-defined citation characterization, for example by using the Open Annotation Data Model, as explained at http://semanticpublishing.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/extending-cito-for-open-annotations/.\n"@en ;
