	rdfs:comment """PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology for describing roles in the publication process, or in other scholarly activities or situations, held by particular agent.  The role can be specified to exist over a defined period of time, and within a specific context, e.g. with respect to a particular document. 

PRO forms part of SPAR, a suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies.  Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/."""@en ;
	dc:description """PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL for the characterization of the roles of agents (people, corporate bodies and computational agents) in the publication process.  It permits one to specify how an agent has a role relating to a contextual entity, and the period of time during which that role is held.

It is based on the Time-indexed Value in Context (TVC) ontology pattern (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc).

It is easy to extend the set of specified roles, simply by adding new individuals to the class pro:PublishingRole.

This ontology is imported into SCoRO, the Scholarly Contribution and Roles Ontology (http://purl.org/spar/scoro/), where it is used similarly to enable the description of a wider range of contributions and roles relating to other scholarly activities and entities, including academic administration, funded projects, research investigations, data and authorship, and to define their temporal extents and contexts, as for publishing roles in PRO."""@en , """Since roles have contexts and times that are important to take into account (for example, a person can be author of one paper and reviewer of another, while another person will be editor of a journal only for a defined period, not for ever), the PRO ontology permit these contexts to be specified, using an ontological design pattern called the time-indexed value in context (TVC) (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/) which is imported into PRO. 
 
This ontology design pattern permits one to construct the following RDF statements:
       foaf:Agent pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime pro:withRole pro:editor ] .

Thus the domain of pro:withRole is not foaf:Agent, but rather an anonymous member of the class pro:RoleInTime, which itself is the range of the property pro:holdsRoleInTime, for which the domain is foaf:Agent. 

The range of pro:withRole is the class pro:Role, whose members permit specific roles to be specified.  
   
This single step of indirection permits other contextual and temporal attributes (not shown here) to be specified for this member of the class pro:RoleInTime, putting that role into context.

Exemplar usage: 

 foaf:Agent pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime pro:withRole pro:editor ] ."""@en ;
