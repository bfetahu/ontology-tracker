	dc:description """PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL for the characterization of the roles of agents (people, corporate bodies and computational agents) in the publication process.  It permits one to specify how an agent has a role relating to a contextual entity, and the period of time during which that role is held.

It is based on the Time-indexed Value in Context (TVC) ontology pattern (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc).

It is easy to extend the set of specified roles, simply by adding new individuals to the class pro:Role or its sub-classes.

This ontology is imported into SCoRO, the Scholarly Contribution and Roles Ontology (http://purl.org/spar/scoro/), where it is used similarly to enable the description of a wider range of contributions and roles relating to other scholarly activities and entities, including academic administration, funded projects, research investigations, data and authorship."""^^xsd:string ;

The role can be specified to exist over a defined period of time, and within a specific context, e.g. with respect to a particular document. 

PRO forms part of SPAR, a suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies.  Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/."""@en , "This ontology is available at http://purl.org/spar/pro, and uses the namespace prefix pro."@en ;
