	dc:description """FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web descriptions of entities that are published or potentially publishable, and that contain or are referred to by bibliographic references, or entities used to define such bibliographic references. FaBiO entities are primarily textual publications such as books, magazines, newspapers and journals, and items of their content such as poems and journal articles.  However, they also include datasets, computer algorithms, experimental protocols, formal specifications and vocabularies, legal records, governmental papers, technical and commercial reports and similar publications, and also bibliographies, reference lists, library catalogues and similar collections.
                
FaBiO classes are structured according to the FRBR schema of Works, Expressions, Manifestations and Items. Additional properties have been added to extends the FRBR data model by linking Works and Manifestations (fabio:hasManifestation and fabio:isManifestationOf), Works and Items (fabio:hasPortrayal and fabio:isPortrayedBy), and Expressions and Items  (fabio:hasRepresentation and fabio:isRepresentedBy)."""@en ;

FaBiO works, and their expressions and manifestations, are primarily textual publications such as books, magazines, newspapers and journals, and items of their content.  However, they also include datasets, computer algorithms, experimental protocols, formal specifications and vocabularies, legal records, governmental papers, technical and commercial reports and similar publications, and also bibliographies, reference lists, library catalogues and similar collections. For this reason, fabio:Work is not an equivalent class to frbr:ScholarlyWork.  An example of a fabio:Work is your latest research paper."@en .

skos:Concept a owl:Class ;

	rdfs:comment """A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive.

The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS.

Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this class."""@en .

skos:ConceptScheme a owl:Class ;

Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may also be viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however, meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some flexibility in the formal data model stated below.

The notion of a concept scheme is useful when dealing with data from an unknown source, and when dealing with data that describes two or more different knowledge organization systems."""@en .
