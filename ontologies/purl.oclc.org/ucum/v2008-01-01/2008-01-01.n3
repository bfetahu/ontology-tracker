        rdfs:comment      "Units that are derived from exactly one base unit. There are two main possibilities. On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en ;

For instance, the meter unit is uniquely related to the length property. Under our ontological approach, units are abstract spaces used as a reference metrics for quality spaces, such as physical qualia, and they are counted by some number. For instance, weight-units define some quality spaces for the weight-quality where specific weights of objects, like devices or persons, are located by means of comparisons with the proper weight-value of the selected weight-unit."@en ;
