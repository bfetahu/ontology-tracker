It is not necessary that the medium be such that a human can perceive the work, as long as the work can be perceived by a machine. Thus, the song is also fixed the moment the author records it onto a cassette tape. Similarly, a computer program is fixed when stored on a computer hard drive.
From the legal point of view, the fixations that are governed are those that store performances of works. The more important kinds of fixations are sound recordings and motion pictures.
