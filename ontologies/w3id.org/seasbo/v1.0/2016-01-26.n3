There is no single accepted categorization available. This taxonomy uses some types selected from:\r\n\r\n- International building occupancy based categories (USA)\r\n- The Classification of Types of Constructions (EU)\r\n- Finnish building categorization VTJ2000 (Finland)\r\n- Wikipedia category page for Rooms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rooms\r\n\r\nThis ontology should limit the overlap with the following existing specialized ontologies:\r\n\r\n- [FIEMSER ontology](http://sites.google.com/site/smartappliancesproject/ontologies/fiemser#).\r\n- [gbXML ontology](http://www.gbxml.org/).\r\n- [ifcOWL ontology](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC4), which is a OWL version of the Building Information Model standard.\r\n- the potential ontology that might be developed in the context of the [Linked Building Data community group](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/), or its successor Working Group.\r\n"@en ;
