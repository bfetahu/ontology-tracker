Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.

This classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions.
